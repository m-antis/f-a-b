Find-A-Bin

Trends come and go and sometimes we need to make room for other things.
Instead of throwing your items out, another option would be to donate them!

With the use of the Google Maps API and Geocoder gem, this Find-A-Bin application shows the New York locations of various organizations that take donation items. When a new org is added, it automatically gets added to the menu list on the "add a location" form on the front page. Immediately after a location is added successfully, the marker is pinned onto the map with it's unique marker. The viewer is also able to filter the orgs they see on the map by clicking the checkboxes.

Currently, the viewer is able to add an organization and a location but the future version of this app will only allow admins to create and modify this data. 

There are some orgs and locations data hardcoded into the app as seeds.
Also note that this version only allows maximum 4 orgs, but the viewer can add as many locations to try out the functionality of this app.
